This is a simple web speedometer app that runs in node.js. It's part of
a class I am taking on Udemy on geolocation. I decided to move it to Heroku
so I can serve the files with https. I do not want oto go through the effort
to make a web server, get certificates, etc just to use https. Https is needed
because most web browsers will restrict calls to navigator.geolocation.watchPosition()
to either local files or https web locations. If you try to start the app on
local PC with node app.js you get an error message when browsing to
http:://<ip of my PC>:3000. If I serve it fromHeroku it will work with https.
